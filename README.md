### Response Variable and Predictors:

**Response Variable:** `area` which is the burned area in forest. 
- We see the original paper used this variable after log transformation since *variable is very skewed towards 0.0*. After fitting the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform

**Predictiors:** We need to assign dummy variables for categorical variables `month` and `day`. 


The area variable before `log(area+1)` transformation:

The area variable after `log(area+1)` transformation:

 As we can see from the histograms, log transformation helps the area variable to spread out. 



#### Model and Feature Selection Process:

I will also try predict the `area` variable via regression models.

 - First, I fit the data with all features to Random Forest Regression with pruned `depth` hyperparameters.
 - Then I will use to Lasso(L1 regularization) Regression and ElasticNet(L1+L2 regularization) Regression to select features. I will not use Ridge(L2 regularization) since it does not any exact zero weigthed features.
 - As last step, I will fit the data to Random Forest Regression with pruned `depth` hyperparameters onto both features selected by Lasso and ElasticNet.

 ### How to Run the Analysis
 
First, please clone or download the repository.

Then, open `ForestFiresAnalysis.ipynb` in your preference of Python notebook environment.

You can run all the code and see the result files are generated.
 
 ### Dependencies
 
 The following python libraries are required to be able to perform the analysis.
 
 - `pandas`
 -  `numpy`
 - `matplotlib`
 - `sklearn`
